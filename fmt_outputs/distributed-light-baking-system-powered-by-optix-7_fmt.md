## Understanding Global Illumination Solutions in Games

![width:500px](/home/fit-sizhe/dwhelper/gtc/sum_outputs/distributed-light-baking-system-powered-by-optix-7_output/screenshots/scene_1.jpg)

*   **Key Goal**: Create realistic lighting by simulating light bouncing off surfaces.
*   **Lighting Equation:**
    *   Direct Lighting + Diffuse GI + Specular GI
        *   **Diffuse GI**:  Indirect light, changing infrequently.
        *   **Specular GI**: Mirror-like reflections, generally simpler to calculate.
*   **Two Main Approaches**: Realtime vs. Baked GI

## Understanding Global Illumination Solutions in Games (Cont.)

*   **Realtime GI**:
    *   Uses surfels, voxels, and probes
    *   Supports dynamic lighting and scene changes.
    *   Complex performance requirements during gameplay
*   **Baked GI**:
    *   Pre-calculates lighting (lightmaps, probes)
    *   Static light sources and scenes.
    *   Higher visual quality, lower gameplay cost.

*   **Comparison of Approaches**:
    *   Baked GI: Better visual quality, unified pipeline.
    *   Cons: Time-consuming production, increased game size, no dynamic lighting.
*   **MagicDawn**: Addresses Baked GI limitations.
